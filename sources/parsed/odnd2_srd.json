You can choose from any of the \nfollowing effects when you cast this spell. As an \naction on your turn, you can repeat the same effect \nor choose a different one.\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing \nwater in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the \narea includes a shore, the flooding water spills over \nonto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you \ninstead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from \none side of the area to the other and then crashes \ndown. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's \npath are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge \nor smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 \npercent chance of capsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell \nends or you choose a different effect. If this effect \nproduced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of \nyour next turn while the flood effect lasts.\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move \napart and create a trench. The trench extends across \nthe spell's area, and the separated water forms a \nwall to either side. The trench remains until the spell \nends or you choose a different effect. The water then \nslowly fills in the trench over the course of the next \nround until the normal water level is restored.\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the \narea to move in a direction you choose, even if the \nwater has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in \nother unlikely directions. The water in the area \nmoves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the \nspell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain \nconditions. The water continues to move in the \ndirection you chose until the spell ends or you \nchoose a different effect.\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at \nleast 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a \nwhirlpool to form in the center of the area. The \nwhirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the \nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. \nAny creature or object in the water and within 25 \nfeet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A \ncreature can swim away from the vortex by making a \nStrength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first \ntime on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a \nStrength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature \ntakes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the \nvortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the \ncreature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the \nvortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its \naction to try to swim away from the vortex as \ndescribed above, but has disadvantage on the \nStrength (Athletics) check to do so.\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the \nvortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; \nthis damage occurs each round it remains in the \nvortex.",

For example, if you tried to travel 120 \nmiles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the \ntwo d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, \nor 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off \ntarget randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as \nnorth, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the \npoints of the compass. If you were teleporting to a \ncoastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you \ncould be in trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target \nobject) wind up in a different area that's visually or \nthematically similar to the target area.

Generally, \nyou appear in the closest similar place, but since the \nspell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind \nup anywhere on the plane.\nMishap. The spell's unpredictable magic results in \na difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the \ntarget object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM \nrerolls on the table to see where you wind up \n(multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each \ntime).",

Within \nthe sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures \ndisappear, and even magic items become mundane. \nUntil the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, \ncentered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those \ncreated by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in \nthe sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot \nexpended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. \nWhile an effect is suppressed, it doesn't function, but \nthe time it spends suppressed counts against its \nduration.\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, \nsuch as magic missile and charm person, that target a \ncreature or an object in the sphere have no effect on \nthat target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or \nmagical effect, such as fireball, can't extend into the \nsphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the \npart of the area that is covered by the sphere is \nsuppressed. For example, the flames created by a \nwall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, \ncreating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large \nenough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a \ncreature or an object in the sphere is suppressed \nwhile the creature or object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic \nitems are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a \n+1 longsword in the sphere functions as a \nnonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon's properties and powers are \nsuppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere \nor wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic \nweapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves \nthe sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or \nthrow a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), \nthe magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as \nsoon as it exits.\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel \nfail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the \ndestination or the departure point for such magical \ntravel. A portal to another location, world, or plane \nof existence, as well as an opening to an \nextradimensional space such as that created by the \nrope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the \nsphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object \nsummoned or created by magic temporarily winks \nout of existence in the sphere. Such a creature \ninstantly reappears once the space the creature \noccupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as \ndispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, \nthe spheres created by different antimagic field\nspells don't nullify each other.",

On a failed save, the creature is \nrestrained. It must then make a Constitution saving \nthrow at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully \nsaves three times, the spell ends.

If you \nconcentrate on this spell for the full duration, the \ntransformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a \ncreature with 0 hit points. An unwilling creature can \nmake a Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it \nisn't affected by this spell.\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into \nanother kind of creature, the new form can be any \nkind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to \nor less than the target's (or its level, if the target \ndoesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game \nstatistics, including mental ability scores, are \nreplaced by the statistics of the new form. It retains \nits alignment and personality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, \nand when it reverts to its normal form, the creature \nreturns to the number of hit points it had before it \ntransformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 \nhit points, any excess damage carries over to its \nnormal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't \nreduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it \nisn't knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can \nperform by the nature of its new form, and it can't \nspeak, cast spells, or take any other action that \nrequires hands or speech, unless its new form is \ncapable of such actions.\nThe target's gear melds into the new form. The \ncreature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise \nbenefit from any of its equipment.\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into \nany kind of creature, as long as the creature's size is \nno larger than the object's size and the creature's \nchallenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is \nfriendly to you and your companions. It acts on each \nof your turns. You decide what action it takes and \nhow it moves. The GM has the creature's statistics \nand resolves all of its actions and movement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer \ncontrol the creature. It might remain friendly to you, \ndepending on how you have treated it.\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into \nan object, it transforms along with whatever it is \nwearing and carrying into that form. The creature's \nstatistics become those of the object, and the \ncreature has no memory of time spent in this form, \nafter the spell ends and it returns to its normal form.",

        "description": "Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. \nBy simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very \nfoundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other \nspell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet \nany requirements in that spell, including costly \ncomponents. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following \neffects of your choice:\n\u2022 You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value \nthat isn't a magic item. The object can be no more \nthan 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in \nan unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\u2022 You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see \nto regain all hit points, and you end all effects on \nthem described in the greater restoration spell.\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures that you can see \nresistance to a damage type you choose.\n\u2022 You grant up to ten creatures you can see \nimmunity to a single spell or other magical effect \nfor 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself \nand all your companions immune to a lich's life \ndrain attack.\n\u2022 You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll \nof any roll made within the last round (including \nyour last turn). Reality reshapes itself to \naccommodate the new result. For example, a wish\nspell could undo an opponent's successful save, a \nfoe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can \nforce the reroll to be made with advantage or \ndisadvantage, and you can choose whether to use \nthe reroll or the original roll.\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the \nscope of the above examples. State your wish to the \nGM as precisely as possible. The GM has great \nlatitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; \nthe greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that \nsomething goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, \nthe effect you desire might only be partly achieved, \nor you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as \na result of how you worded the wish. For example, \nwishing that a villain were dead might propel you \nforward in time to a period when that villain is no \nlonger alive, effectively removing you from the game. \nSimilarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or \nartifact might instantly transport you to the \npresence of the item's current owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any \neffect other than duplicating another spell weakens \nyou. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a \nspell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 \nnecrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage \ncan't be reduced or prevented in any way. In \naddition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't 3 or \nlower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days \nthat you spend resting and doing nothing more than \nlight activity, your remaining recovery time \ndecreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent \nchance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if \nyou suffer this stress.",

Nonhazardous tasks typically require \nonly half the suggested payment, while especially \ndangerous tasks might require a greater gift. \nCreatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the \nagreed-upon duration of service expires, the \ncreature returns to its home plane after reporting \nback to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. \nIf you are unable to agree on a price for the \ncreature's service, the creature immediately returns \nto its home plane.\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a \nmember of it, receiving a full share of experience \npoints awarded.",
